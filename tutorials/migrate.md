@page migrate Upgrading to 3.2
@parent tutorials 8

There are many new feature in JavaScriptMVC 3.2 that help you build great JavaScript applications.
Although 3.2 is not strictly backwards compatible it is possible to upgrade from
and earlier version. This guide outlines the things you have to look at when upgrading from
version 3.0 or 3.1.

## Steal

[stealjs | Steal] has experienced a major improvement, making it even easier to manage your dependencies.
Instead of defining what you want to steal like _steal.plugins_, _steal.controllers_ or _steal.views_ you
just steal the file and Steal will figure out what to do with it based on the extension.
So if your code used to look like this:

	steal('helper').plugins('jquery/controller', 'jquery/view/ejs', 'jquery/controller/view').views('init.ejs')
		.css('style').then(function($) {
		$.Controller('Test.Controller', {}, {
			init : function(el, ops)
			{
				this.element.html(this.view());
			}
		});
	});

The new Steal looks like this:

	steal('./helper.js', 'jquery/controller', 'jquery/view/ejs', './views/init.ejs', './style.css', function($) {
		$.Controller('Test.Controller', {}, {
			init : function(el, ops)
			{
				this.element.html(this.view());
			}
		});
	});
	
The rules when stealing a file:

* ./ refers to the path of the current file
* When stealing something without extension like _jquery/controller_ Steal will first look for the plugin
file _jquery/controller/controller.js_ and if not found _jquery/controller.js_ based on your applications
root path
* ./helper.js loads helper.js in the folder of the current file
* ./views/init.ejs loads the init.ejs [jQuery.EJS | EJS view] from views subfolder in the current folder
* ./style.css loads the style.css file in the current folder

Note that the new Steal runs asynchronously so you might have to be more careful using _steal.then()_
if there are dependencies that have to be loaded before another. This is also important when putting code
outside of steal. Because jQuery hasn't been loaded you can not use the jQuery object. So instead of
$(document).ready use this:

    steal.then(function() {
		$('body').my_plugin();
    });


## Organizing your application

Starting with version 3.1 and fully encouraged in 3.2 JavaScriptMVC follows a new approach in organizing your application structure.
Read the complete guide on [organizing | organizing your app] to get an idea. For migrating from the old structure
the following things are important:

* The use of the _controllers_ folder is discouraged. You still can use it but organizing each controller in
their own folder with a views subfolder is the preferred way as it is a lot more obvious how your application
is split up and easier to test.
* Models reside in their own folder as they might be application wide and not controller specific
(e.g. a recipe model will be used in a recipe\_edit and a recipe\_list controller)

 
## Document controllers
 
There are no document controllers in 3.2 anymore (controllers that used have the default option _{ onDocument : true }_).
Instead initialize your controllers like any [jquery.controller.plugin | jQuery plugin] in the application file.
For document wide controllers initialize them on the document itself. 
An example how your main application file may look like:

	steal('my/controller', 'my/global/controller', function($) {
		$(document).ready(function($) {
			$(document).global_controller();
			$('.thing').my_controlller();
		});
	});

Note that unlike the old document controllers a global controller will not listen to a specific id.

## Listening to model changes
 
The notifications via OpenAJAX have been dropped in favor of the [jQuery.Observe Observable] mechanism.
Check out the documentation on [jquery.model.events | Model events] for detailed information on how use it for Models. 

## Controller History

Controller history using OpenAjax has been removed in 3.2. Use [jQuery.route] for full history and routing support.

## Wrap Removed

The AJAX response converter 'wrap' and 'wrapMany' have been removed in favor of a [native jQuery converter http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/#Converters].

Before, you would do a _this.callback_ on the success like:

	findAll : function(params, success, error ){
		return $.ajax({
			url: '/services/recipes.json',
			type: 'get',
			data: params
			dataType : 'json',
			success: this.callback(['wrapMany',success])
		});
	}

now becomes:

	findAll : function(params, success, error ){
		return $.ajax({
			url: '/services/recipes.json',
			type: 'get',
			data: params
			dataType : 'json recipe.models',
			success: success
			});
		}
		
## Callback Renamed to Proxy

The _this.callback_ method has been deprecated and the preferred method is now _this.proxy_.

## steal.browser.rhino removed

The _steal.browser.rhino_ has been removed. We are using _steal.browsers_ namespace for the browser drivers.  If you were using this to have rhino skip files in the build process, you can now use: _steal.isRhino_.
