@parent tutorials 3

This tutorial will cover building a 
basic tabs widget with StealJS.  For now, this is a rough outline.

### Installing Steal

Download StealJS or JavaScriptMVC and unzip it in a public folder.

### Setting up your app.

JavaScriptMVC encourages you to have two root 
folders.  One for reusable widgets, plugins and 
other code that can be potentially used across multiple applications.

The other folder will be code specific to your application.


### Setting up your page

In a page, add the script tag.

### Loading Scripts

Load other scripts

### Load other types (Less and Coffee)

### Installing Other Scripts 

This should be about steal.get.  It should have someone install
the steal'ed version of jQueryUI.

### Cleaning Scripts

Our scripts are ugly, we can clean them ... or JS lint them ...

### Make your site crawl-able
